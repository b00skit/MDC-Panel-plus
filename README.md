## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All runtime settings live in `data/config.json`. The application reads this file during server rendering and inside client components, so changes take effect without rebuilding the codebase. 

**Site lifecycle and identity**

* **`SITE_LIVE`** ‚Äì When `false`, the root layout renders a maintenance screen instead of the dashboard, which is useful for taking the panel offline during upgrades. 
* **`SITE_NAME`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_IMAGE`, `SITE_FAVICON`, `SITE_LOGO`, `SITE_VERSION`** ‚Äì Populate metadata, OpenGraph/Twitter previews, and footer branding across the app. 
* **`SITE_URL`** ‚Äì Sets the canonical base URL used for metadata construction and for redirecting beta users back to production. 
* **`SITE_LANGUAGE`** ‚Äì Forces a specific locale to load regardless of browser preferences, allowing operators to pin the UI language. 
* **`SITE_DISCORD_CONTACT`** ‚Äì Displayed on the About page so users know who to reach for support. 

**Release management and beta tooling**

* **`CACHE_VERSION`** ‚Äì When incremented, the client clears browser caches/cookies and reloads to ensure users fetch new static data. 
* **`LOCAL_STORAGE_VERSION`** ‚Äì Works like `CACHE_VERSION`, but specifically clears `localStorage` to invalidate persisted drafts or settings. 
* **`BETA_ENABLED`** and **`BETA_CODE`** ‚Äì Gatekeep beta environments; if beta access is disabled, users on beta domains must enter the configured code to continue. 

**Feature toggles and calculator limits**

* **`ENABLE_FORM_BUILDER`** ‚Äì Enables the Paperwork Generator Builder UI when set to `true`. 
* **`MAX_SENTENCE_DAYS`, `MAX_IMPOUND_DAYS`, `MAX_SUSPENSION_DAYS`** ‚Äì Cap the arrest calculator outputs and show warnings when totals exceed policy. 
* **`PAROLE_VIOLATION_DEFINITION`** ‚Äì Names the parole violation addition so calculators and reports can treat it specially. 

**External data delivery**

* **`CONTENT_DELIVERY_NETWORK`** ‚Äì Base URL for fetching GTAW datasets when CDN delivery is allowed. 
* **`DISABLE_GTAW_CDN`** ‚Äì Forces the app to serve GTAW data from its own API route instead of the CDN when `true`. 

**Link directory**

* All **`URL_*`** entries (e.g., `URL_DISCORD`, `URL_PENAL_CODE`, `URL_STREETS`) centralize outbound links so that content files such as `help.json` and `resources.json` can reference them by key. 

The visual theme, colors, and layout remain defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/app/globals.css` following the project's design blueprint.

## üåê Internationalization (i18n)

Translations are stored as locale-specific JSON dictionaries under `data/i18n`. The Next.js config automatically reads the available files and exposes the list of locales to the client. 

At runtime the server resolves the active locale by checking `SITE_LANGUAGE`, then a `locale` cookie, and finally the browser's `Accept-Language` header, falling back to English when no match is found. 

Client components consume translations through the i18n provider, and the language switcher writes a `locale` cookie before refreshing the router so the new language is rendered across the app. 

**Adding a new language**

1. Create `data/i18n/<locale>.json` (copy `en.json` as a template) and translate each key. Keep the same nested structure so components can resolve strings. 
2. No manual wiring is needed‚ÄîNext.js picks up new locale files automatically, and the locale list is published via `NEXT_PUBLIC_I18N_LOCALES`. 
3. Add human-readable labels for the new locale inside the language switcher or reuse the locale code directly. 
4. Optional: set `SITE_LANGUAGE` in `config.json` to force every visitor to use the new locale by default. 

Users can swap languages from the settings sidebar at any time; the selection persists in a long-lived cookie managed by the switcher component.

## üìà Analytics Tracking

Anonymous analytics are configured through `data/analytics.json`, which stores the Matomo endpoint and site ID.  The `Matomo` client component reads those values, honors the user's opt-out preference from local storage, and only initializes tracking during production builds. 

To point the panel at your own analytics server, update the URL and tracker ID in `analytics.json`. The opt-out toggle on the Settings page will continue to suppress tracking because the component checks the shared `site-settings-storage` state before sending events. 

---

## üì∞ Announcements, Notices, and Changelog

These UI surfaces are powered entirely by JSON files in the `data/` directory.

* **Announcements** ‚Äì `data/announcements.json` contains an ordered list of announcement cards with `id`, `date`, `title`, `content`, and optional button metadata. The sidebar compares the highest stored `id` against local storage to calculate an unread badge. 
* **Dashboard notice** ‚Äì `data/notice.json` defines a single alert banner that can be dismissed per-session, including severity (`variant`), icon name, and optional CTA behavior. 
* **Changelog** ‚Äì `data/changelog.json` tracks release history with version metadata and categorized change items. Editors can append entries at the top of the array; optional `cacheVersion` fields align with `CACHE_VERSION` to bust caches when large data migrations occur. 

Edit these files, commit the changes, and redeploy; the UI will automatically render the new content without additional wiring.

---

## üÜò Help & Resource Content

Support content is also data-driven:

* `data/help.json` defines the quick links and FAQ entries for the Help page. Each resource item can either open a feedback dialog or resolve a URL key from `config.json`, while FAQs render Markdown-style emphasis. 
* `data/resources.json` supplies reusable resource cards on the Caselaw page, supporting external links, inline dialogs, and copy-to-clipboard actions. Each card can reference `config.json` URLs or embed its own content block. 

Update these JSON files to add, remove, or tweak help resources without touching React components.
